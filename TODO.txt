SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION  

Isaac Sim Data Generation: 
* add rect light to model illuminator 
* add disk light to model glare 
* add disk light to model glint/stray light 
* add variable light sources
* add distractors: mesh, shape, texture 
* add distractor randomization: color, texture, position, rotation, scale 
* add distractor physics: floating, falling, bouncing 

Data Processing and Augmentation: 
* add luma balancing between marker and background using segmentation images 
* compute keypoints based on marker pattern, marker-cam pose, and camera properties 

Housekeeping: 
* refactor directory handling 
* finalize background images library and write script for copying data
