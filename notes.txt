Lighting: 

- desired lighting effects: 
    - high/low brightness <-- light brightness [DONE]
    - shadows <-- objects between light source and marker, or texture on light, or post-processing 
    - sun/earth <-- distant light [DONE]
    - illuminator <-- rect light  
    - glare <-- high intensity medium disk light directed at marker 
    - glint/stray light <-- high intensity small disk light directed at camera
